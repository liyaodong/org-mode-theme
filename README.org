* Why This Project?
  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web.html][Org-mode]] is the most powerful tool I've used, usually I'll use org-mode to write slides by [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]] or write blog post, I found writting email in Gmail is not that perfect as a frontend developer who using emacs and vim. what if I can write email in emacs by using vim? what if I can use css and html to beautify it? Yes! Genius! right, the repo will store my themes for org exported html by using ~C-c C-e h o~.

* How to use?
- Write your email or document by org-mode
- Add below meta information on top of the org file
#+BEGIN_SRC orgmode
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liyaodong/org-mode-theme/master/theme/email-clean-enough.css"/>
#+END_SRC
- export to html by ~C-c C-e h o~

* Theme list
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output replace :exports results
ls theme/*.css|awk '/\.css/{print "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liyaodong/org-mode-theme/master/"$0" "}'
#+END_SRC

Think about this theme list is out of date?

:doge: No Way ! I'm using the tool [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][babel]] in org-mode that can provide real-time scripting feature! (just kidding, press the ~C-c C-c~ can update the list by shell script)
